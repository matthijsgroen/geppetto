# Getting started

Hey! Welcome to Geppetto! With Geppetto you can create 2D animations from your image using the Geppetto Studio, and embed those animations in any website using Geppetto Player.

## Features

- 🎬 **Capable of animations & runtime controls**

  Define animations and play them a single time or in a loop. Control the playback speed. Use controls to tweak images in real-time. Check out the [playground](./playground.mdx) to see what we mean.

- 🐣 **Small in size**

  Size: **7.84 kB** with all dependencies, minified and gzipped

- ⚖️ **Open source**

  The entire project (Studio / Player) is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/matthijsgroen/geppetto/blob/main/LICENSE). You can see all the internals, and improve upon them 🙂.

- 🍻 **Free to use & distribute**

  You can download, use in any kind of project without explicit permission. Just use and enjoy!

- 🌱 **Energy efficient**

  Maybe this library is not super feature rich, but that is also because I want to focus on efficient rendering. I want to be able to make an adventure game you could play on your phone for hours, not 20 minutes before the battery is drained.

- 🕸 **Made for the web**

  Only JavaScript/TypeScript code here. Feel free to support the JSON format for players in other languages though 😇
