# Getting started

Hey! Welcome to Geppetto! With Geppetto you can create 2D animations from your image.

## Why does Geppetto exist?

### Motivation

I like to tinker with webbased game development. You can create characters and backgrounds using 2d art, and use CSS to position them. But for characters to feel alive, you need to add different poses and facial expressions. These could then be layered on top of eachother in css as well.

But characters feel way more alive if they would have some subtle motion to them. For this purpose, I created this animation tool. To make 2d art feel more alive.

Looking at other tools, I ran into limitations. They were either not open-source, had specifics about usage and distribution, or had a monthly fee. When you just want to experiment and learn about drawing and animation, or want to use the web as distribution platform, those options where too limited for me.

Make no mistake, there are probably better tools out there. Tools that have 100s of features. But I only would need a few. And keeping the amount of features simple, I hope to save a bit on required performance. It is nice if you have a cool smooth animation running on your phone with real time controls. It is not nice if it drains your battery in 20 minutes.

### Goals

1. Free to use & distribute
2. Open source
3. Capable of animations & runtime controls
4. Energy efficient
5. Made for the web

## How does Geppetto work?

1. Texture
2. Layers
3. Mutations
