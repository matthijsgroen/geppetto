# Download

Currently the **Geppetto Studio app** is only available as installable Desktop application for Mac, Linux and Windows. In the future I hope to also make it available directly from the browser.

<DownloadButtons version={"1.3.0"} />

## Installation

The apps are untrusted at the moment, if you don't trust it, you can either checkout the electron code at https://github.com/matthijsgroen/geppetto/tree/main/public/electron to review yourself if you trust what I'm doing.
