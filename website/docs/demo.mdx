## Overview of animated elements

### Scenery animations

- The spider in the attic goes up and down, using a [translation][] with a
  radius (pulling the string of the spider longer).
- The sun and clouds move, using a [translation][].
- The trees sway with the [deformation][] mutation.
- The water of the water wheel moves using a [translation][] mutation.
- The blades of the wheel move using a [translation][] mutation combined
  with a [stretch][] mutation.
- The wheel turns using a [stretch][] mutation combined with a [rotation][] mutation.
- The depth of layers is done by the [color transition][] mutation, with a color
  set with a [target color][].
- The day/night cycle is done by updating the colors of the [target color][]
  mutation and adjusting the brightness with the [lightness][] mutation.
- The beak of the bird is done with the [rotation][] mutation.
- The eyes of at the hole near the water is done by the [opacity][] mutation.

### Butterfly

The butterfly wings is an animation loop, (using [stretch][] and [rotation][]). But its
actually controlled by a small script. The location destination is random, and the butterfly's
direction is flipped using the [stretch][] effect. There are 2 landing spots defined,
and when landed, the wings animation is changed.

### Inkeeper animations

- Head tilting is done with the [rotation][] mutation, combined with the hair movement with a [deformation][].
- Head turning is done with multiple [translation][] effects moving different layers with different amounts.
- Mouth movement is done with a [translation][] on the chin, [deformation][] mutations for the lips, [translation][] on the teeth.
- Eye blinking is done by stretching the eyelids with a [deformation][] and flipping the eyelashes with a [stretch][] effect.
- Eyes direction is done with [translation][] effect on the pupils, with a [stretch][] mutation to give the eye a more circular effect.
- Using the broom is done with a multiple of [rotation][] mutations for arm movements.
