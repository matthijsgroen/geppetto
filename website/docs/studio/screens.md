# Screens

Here you can find how each screen works, what its purpose is and even
tutorials how to create cool 2d animated characters!

Geppetto is meant to be an application to create WebGL Animations. The process
of creating an animation has the following steps:

1. Create a texture (outside of Geppetto)
2. [Create layers from the texture](./Layers)
3. [Stack/place the layers](./Composition#moving-layers)
4. [Add mutations to the layers](./Composition#adding-mutations)
5. [Create controls on the mutations](./Composition#adding-controls)
6. [Create animation tracks from the controls](./Animation)

The contents of step 1 is your texture (most of the time: a `.png` file) The
contents of the other steps will be stored in a `.json` file.
